Note : 
flow of Auth :

app.use('/',checkAuth,staticRouter); 
- get req with / then first checkAuth(middleware) if user are login are not Previously by session id.

- if user req to login at path /login (staticRouter) --> render login page and after submit --> post req with path /user/login -->check user exist or not --> if exist then redirect to / path.

esay way:
-> /login(staticRouter) --> user/login(check in db and set session token) --> /(staticRouter).
 

=> Mobile based auth:
  - it is use because cookies concept work only on web browser.
  - there we send the token as a respose --> then client store token in user device --> then client sent req.headers["authorization"] --> here contain the "Bearer <token>" --> then get token and check user are valid or not.
  - if user have a token then does not required to login again.
  - it token handle and store by user
