Note : 
flow of Auth :

app.use('/',checkAuth,staticRouter); 
- get req with / then first checkAuth(middleware) if user are login are not Previously by session id.

- if user req to login at path /login (staticRouter) --> render login page and after submit --> post req with path /user/login -->check user exist or not --> if exist then redirect to / path.

esay way:
-> /login(staticRouter) --> user/login(check in db and set session token) --> /(staticRouter)
